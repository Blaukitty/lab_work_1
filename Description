The Munchkin Game 

Description:
This is a text adaptation of everyone's favorite game, in which you get the opportunity to play against AI. You have the opportunity to choose
your character - his race (elf, human or dwarf) and his class (hunter, traveler or knight). Players fight
against each other on the text field.

The interface, implemented using ASCII characters, will include two decks of "clothes" and "doors" cards. 
The cards lying on the field, the opponent's cards and yours will also be displayed. You won't be able to see what kind of cards the AI has.

The course of the game:
Step1 - You receive two cards from each deck.
Step2 - A card is selected from the "door" deck: either a monster that you have to fight, or a poisonous apple - a "surprise" card, or
poison, alas, you are unlucky, or treasure. For defeating a monster, you get money with which you can level up or buy a card
from the "clothes". The first move will always be yours. The AI can annoy you (as well as you can him) and throw a card that strengthens the monster. If the monster
turns out to be too strong, you can escape. The possibility of each of your decisions is determined by the level of the monster and the value of one or another
stats (speed, defense, or damage). If your level is less than the monster's level, and at the same time it is faster than you, then your level is reset to zero -
you die. You get money for killing a monster.
Step3 - After you have money, your level increases at their expense. Each new level costs more!
Step4 is the AI's move.

dies <3

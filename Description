Game Munchkin.
This is an exciting game, reminiscent of Russian roulette. Here it is impossible to predict who will win and who will lose, everything depends on your luck.

During the game, as in the usual Munchkin, you are given cards - from doors and from clothes, but 2 pieces each. These cards remain with you until the end of the game. You can also
choose your race and occupation, just follow the instructions in the terminal window! This gives the game soulfulness and vibe dnd)

You have the opportunity to fight with Artificial Intelligence, it can do the same as you - it can throw you an enemy card, it can fight
monsters.

A special charm to the game is given by the feeling of the unknown, since if one of the players gets a card NOT a monster, then his level will rapidly increase,
and because of this he will be closer to victory. If you are unlucky and the monster turns out to be stronger than you, you should not be upset, because your
level will not change for the worse, it will just stand still. For defeating a monster, you will be awarded money, and if there is exactly twice as much money
as your current level, it will increase by 1!

A little more detail about the fight. Monster cards have 4 characteristics, while your cards only have 1. This is also part of Russian roulette and adds excitement to the game.
Your final damage is calculated from the card you decided to fight with, from your clothes, your profession and class.

Have a good game \(^ w ^)/

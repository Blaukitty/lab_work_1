Вот краткое описание:

Жанр: Текстовая карточная RPG с элементами русской рулетки.

Начало: Игрок выбирает расу (человек, эльф, дворф) и класс (охотник, путешественник, рыцарь), получая бонусы к характеристикам — урон, защита или скорость.

Механика:

Игрок и AI имеют характеристики: урон, защита, скорость, деньги, уровень.

Существует две колоды карт — "одежда" (например, chain mail, swift boots) и "двери" (монстры или события — Kisame, Toby).

Игрок получает карты, которые влияют на характеристики и сражается с противниками.

Интерфейс: Текстовый вывод с блоками статусов и действий

1 Launching the game
I just launched the game and made sure that it starts without errors and immediately shows the menu.

2 Selecting a race and class
I checked that when entering "elf", "human", "dwarf" the game accepts the choice and writes bonuses.
The same for "hunter", "traveler", "knight".

3 Dealing cards
After the start, I made sure that exactly 2 cards are dealt from the "clothes" deck and 2 from the "doors".

4 Player statuses
Immediately after the deal there is a block, the data changes, although it is not displayed with each move.
Damage: …
Protection: …
Speed: …
Money: …

5 Several moves
I made 3-5 moves, they are executed correctly.
After each move, the statistics are updated and do not fly into negative numbers.

6 Victory/Loss
I finished the fight and the game reports a victory or defeat.

7 Leveling up
The level is growing, messages are coming in about it.

8 Crash checking
If you enter erroneous commands, the game will ask you to enter the correct data.
